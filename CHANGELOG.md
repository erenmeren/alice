# Changelog

## Unreleased — Phase 1: Core

### Added
- Setup wizard: one-time setup code, language, administrator account with mandatory authenticator app and
  10 recovery codes, recovery passphrase (generates the backup key pair).
- Local sign-in with Argon2id passwords (12–128 characters, 100,000-entry leaked-password list), mandatory TOTP,
  recovery codes, progressive delay and 15-minute lockout, step-up confirmation for sensitive changes.
- Sessions (`__Host-alice_session`, 30 minutes idle, 12 hours absolute) with CSRF protection and rate limits.
- Roles Administrator, Operator and Auditor enforced on every API route from one permission table
  (`docs/authz-matrix.md`).
- User management, personal API tokens (read or operate scope, at most 365 days).
- Tamper-evident audit log with viewer, CSV/JSON export and integrity verification (`alice audit verify`).
- Envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM, per-secret key) with a master key file; the application database role cannot
  change or delete audit entries.
- CLI: `alice setup-token --reset`, `alice audit verify`, `alice admin reset-mfa <username>`.
- Guides: `docs/first-run.md`, `docs/admin-guide.md`, `docs/operator-guide.md`.

### Changed
- `/api/v1/version` now requires sign-in.
- Database errors for a wrong password or a missing database stop startup immediately with a clear message.
- Development stack: separate `alice_app` database role; run `make reset` once after upgrading from Phase 0.

### Known issues
- The setup code comes from `alice setup-token --reset` (`make setup-token`); the installer prints it from a later
  release.
- The wizard ends after the recovery passphrase; HTTPS certificate upload, email, license and first target steps
  are added later.
- Account blocks and audit-integrity problems are recorded in the audit log but not emailed or sent to syslog, and
  there is no automatic daily integrity check yet.
- People created by an administrator are not forced to change their initial password.
- API tokens with "read and operate" access can do nothing more than read-only tokens until targets exist.
- In the development stack the database owner used for migrations is the PostgreSQL superuser, and its password is
  in the `alice` container (see `docs/operator-guide.md`).
- The full list, with the security review, is in `docs/security/reviews/phase-1.md` ("Known limitations").
