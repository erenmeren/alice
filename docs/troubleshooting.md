# Troubleshooting

Every error returned by the Alice API carries a stable code in the form `ALC-<AREA>-<NNNN>`. Quote the code and the `request_id` when asking for help.

## Cannot sign in

- **"Incorrect username or password." although the password is right.** After 5 wrong attempts Alice makes the
  account wait a few seconds; after 10 it blocks the account for 15 minutes. Wait and try again with care: until a
  complete sign-in, one more wrong attempt starts a new 15-minute block. An administrator can see `auth.lockout`
  in the audit log, and **Set a new password** on **Users** lifts the block at once. If you are the only
  administrator, the server operator runs `alice admin unlock <username>` ([operator-guide.md](operator-guide.md));
  `alice admin reset-mfa` does not end a block.
- **Lost the phone with the authenticator app.** Choose **Use a recovery code** on the sign-in page. Without
  recovery codes, ask an administrator to reset your MFA (**Users**). If you are the only administrator, the
  server operator runs `alice admin reset-mfa <username>` ([operator-guide.md](operator-guide.md)).
- **"Your session ended. Please sign in again."** Sessions end after 30 minutes without activity and always after
  12 hours. Sign in again.
- **The setup wizard says the setup code is wrong or the session expired.** Create a new code with
  `alice setup-token --reset` (development: `make setup-token`). After five wrong codes the wizard waits
  15 minutes (`ALC-SET-0002`). Once an administrator exists the wizard no longer accepts codes: sign in instead.
- **Alice does not start: "the master key file is missing" / "does not match this database".** See
  [operator-guide.md](operator-guide.md#master-key).
- **Alice does not start: "the database server … rejected the user name or password".** The database password in
  the configuration is wrong, or (development) a Phase 0 database volume lacks the new `alice_app` role: run
  `make reset`.

## ALC-SYS-0001: Not found

**Meaning.** The requested API path does not exist (HTTP 404).

**Likely cause.** A typo in the URL, an outdated client calling a removed endpoint, or a wrong HTTP method on an API route.

**What to do.** Check the path against the API documentation and make sure the client matches the server version (`GET /api/v1/version`).

## ALC-SYS-0002: Alice is temporarily unavailable

**Meaning.** A dependency is not ready, so Alice cannot serve the request (HTTP 503, retryable). `/healthz` returns this code.

**Likely cause.** The database is unreachable (for example still starting after a host reboot) or its migrations have not been applied yet.

**What to do.** Wait a minute and retry. If it persists, check that the database container is running and healthy, then read the Alice logs (`docker compose logs alice`) for the `database_unreachable` or `migrations_pending` reason.

## ALC-SYS-0003: Unexpected error

**Meaning.** Alice hit an unexpected internal problem while handling the request (HTTP 500).

**Likely cause.** A bug or an unforeseen condition. Details are deliberately not shown in the response.

**What to do.** Retry once. If it repeats, look up the `request_id` from the response in the Alice logs and report it together with the steps that led to the error.

## ALC-SYS-0004: Request could not be read

**Meaning.** The request body is not valid JSON, contains fields the endpoint does not accept, or has data after the JSON value (HTTP 400).

**Likely cause.** An outdated browser tab after an upgrade, or an API client sending extra or misspelled fields.

**What to do.** Reload the page. API users: compare the request with the schemas in `api/openapi.yaml`; unknown fields are always rejected.

## ALC-SYS-0005: Too many requests

**Meaning.** A rate limit was reached (HTTP 429, retryable). The `Retry-After` header says how many seconds to wait.

**Likely cause.** More than 300 requests per minute for one session or token, more than 60 per minute from one address without signing in, more than 10 sign-in attempts or 5 verification codes per minute from one address.

**What to do.** Wait for the time in `Retry-After`. If many people share one address through a proxy, ask the administrator to set `ALICE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` so Alice sees real client addresses.

## ALC-SYS-0006: Some fields need attention

**Meaning.** One or more fields failed validation (HTTP 422). `details` lists each field with a `validation.*` code.

**Likely cause.** A required field is empty, a value is too long, or a value does not have the expected format (for example a username with spaces).

**What to do.** Correct the fields named in `details` and send the request again.

## ALC-SYS-0007: Request too large

**Meaning.** The request body is larger than 1 MiB (HTTP 413).

**Likely cause.** A very large paste or file was sent to an endpoint that accepts small JSON documents.

**What to do.** Send less data. Certificate and license uploads (later versions) have their own, larger limit.

## ALC-AUTH-0001: Session ended

**Meaning.** The request has no valid session or API token (HTTP 401).

**Likely cause.** The user signed out, was idle for 30 minutes, reached the 12-hour session limit, was disabled, or an administrator ended their sessions; or an API token expired or was revoked.

**What to do.** Sign in again. API users: create a new token.

## ALC-AUTH-0002: Permission denied

**Meaning.** The signed-in user or token is not allowed to perform this action (HTTP 403). The attempt is recorded in the audit log as `authz.denied`.

**Likely cause.** The user's role (Administrator, Operator, Auditor) does not include the action, or an API token is used for an action that needs a browser session.

**What to do.** Ask an administrator for the right role. See `docs/authz-matrix.md` for who may do what.

## ALC-AUTH-0003: Confirmation required

**Meaning.** A sensitive action needs a fresh verification code (HTTP 403). The confirmation lasts 5 minutes.

**Likely cause.** More than 5 minutes passed since the last sign-in or confirmation, and the action changes users, tokens, recovery codes or backup settings.

**What to do.** Enter the 6-digit code from the authenticator app when Alice asks (`POST /api/v1/auth/stepup`), then repeat the action.

## ALC-AUTH-0004: Request blocked (CSRF)

**Meaning.** A state-changing request did not carry the page's security token, or came from another site (HTTP 403).

**Likely cause.** An old browser tab, a browser extension changing requests, or a malicious page trying to act on the user's behalf.

**What to do.** Reload the page. API clients should use an API token (`Authorization: Bearer alice_...`), which needs no CSRF token.

## ALC-AUTH-0005: Incorrect username or password

**Meaning.** Sign-in failed (HTTP 401). The message is the same whether the user exists, the password is wrong, or the account is temporarily blocked, so attackers learn nothing.

**Likely cause.** A typo, a wrong password, a disabled account, or too many failed attempts: after 5 failures Alice waits 1, 2, 4, ... seconds between attempts, after 10 it blocks the account for 15 minutes.

**What to do.** Wait 15 minutes and try again carefully. An administrator can reset the password in Users. Failed attempts are listed in the audit log (`auth.login`, `auth.lockout`).

## ALC-AUTH-0006: Wrong verification code

**Meaning.** The 6-digit code or the recovery code was not accepted (HTTP 401).

**Likely cause.** A typo, a code that was already used (each code works once), or a phone or server clock that is more than 30 seconds off.

**What to do.** Wait for the next code and try again, or use a recovery code. Check that the server and phone clocks are correct (NTP).

## ALC-AUTH-0007: Authenticator already set up

**Meaning.** The account already has an authenticator app enrolled (HTTP 409).

**Likely cause.** The enrollment page was opened twice.

**What to do.** Enter a code from the app. If the device is lost, an administrator can reset it (Users, "Reset MFA"), or the host administrator can run `alice admin reset-mfa <username>`.

## ALC-AUTH-0008: Password too short

**Meaning.** The new password has fewer than 12 characters (HTTP 422, `params.min`).

**Likely cause.** A short password was chosen.

**What to do.** Use at least 12 characters; a short sentence works well.

## ALC-AUTH-0009: Password too long

**Meaning.** The new password has more than 128 characters (HTTP 422, `params.max`).

**Likely cause.** A very long value was pasted.

**What to do.** Use at most 128 characters.

## ALC-AUTH-0010: Password too common

**Meaning.** The password is on Alice's built-in list of 100,000 commonly used passwords (HTTP 422). The check is offline.

**Likely cause.** A well-known password such as `qwerty123456` was chosen.

**What to do.** Choose a different password that is not used anywhere else.

## ALC-AUTH-0011: Current password incorrect

**Meaning.** When changing a password, the current password did not match (HTTP 422).

**Likely cause.** A typo in the current password field.

**What to do.** Enter the current password again. If it is forgotten, ask an administrator to reset it.

## ALC-AUTH-0012: Account busy, try again

**Meaning.** Alice could not check the password or verification code in time because another check for the same account was still running (HTTP 503, retryable, `Retry-After: 1`). Nothing was verified and the attempt was not counted as a failure.

**Likely cause.** Many sign-in or verification attempts for one account at the same moment, for example a script retrying in parallel or someone guessing the password while the owner signs in.

**What to do.** Wait a second and try again. If it happens often, look in the audit log for many `auth.login` failures on that account and find where they come from.

## ALC-USR-0001: Username already in use

**Meaning.** Another user already has this username (HTTP 409). Usernames ignore case, so `Admin` and `admin` are the same.

**Likely cause.** The person already has an account, or the name is taken.

**What to do.** Choose a different username, or edit the existing user.

## ALC-USR-0002: Last administrator

**Meaning.** The change would leave no enabled local administrator (HTTP 409). Alice always keeps one as a break-glass account.

**Likely cause.** Disabling or demoting the only remaining administrator, including yourself.

**What to do.** Give the Administrator role to another person first, then repeat the change.

## ALC-TOK-0001: Token access not allowed

**Meaning.** The requested token access exceeds what the owner's role allows (HTTP 422).

**Likely cause.** An Auditor asked for a token with "operate" access.

**What to do.** Create a read-only token.

## ALC-SET-0001: Wrong setup code

**Meaning.** The one-time setup code entered in the setup wizard is not correct (HTTP 401).

**Likely cause.** A typo, or the code was replaced by running `setup-token --reset` again.

**What to do.** Type the code exactly as printed (dashes and case do not matter). To get a new code, run `alice setup-token --reset` on the server (in development: `make setup-token`).

## ALC-SET-0002: Setup temporarily blocked

**Meaning.** Five wrong setup codes were entered from this address; setup is blocked for 15 minutes from it (HTTP 429, `Retry-After`).

**Likely cause.** Repeated typos, or someone guessing the code.

**What to do.** Wait 15 minutes. If you did not make these attempts, check who can reach the server.

## ALC-SET-0003: Setup session ended

**Meaning.** The wizard session is missing or expired (HTTP 401).

**Likely cause.** The wizard was idle for 60 minutes, cookies were cleared, or setup was completed in another browser.

**What to do.** Enter the setup code again. If an administrator already exists, sign in instead.

## ALC-SET-0004: Administrator details missing

**Meaning.** The verification-code step of the wizard was sent before the administrator form (HTTP 409).

**Likely cause.** The page was reloaded between the two steps after the wizard session was renewed.

**What to do.** Go back one step and submit the administrator form again.

## ALC-SET-0005: Recovery passphrase too short

**Meaning.** The recovery passphrase has fewer than 16 characters (HTTP 422, `params.min`).

**Likely cause.** A short passphrase was chosen.

**What to do.** Choose at least 16 characters, for example several unrelated words.

## ALC-SET-0006: Passphrases do not match

**Meaning.** The passphrase and its repetition differ (HTTP 422).

**Likely cause.** A typo in one of the two fields.

**What to do.** Type the same passphrase in both fields.

## ALC-SET-0007: Recovery passphrase already set

**Meaning.** A recovery passphrase was already chosen for this installation (HTTP 409).

**Likely cause.** The step was submitted twice.

**What to do.** Continue with the next step. The passphrase cannot be changed in this version.

## ALC-SET-0008: Setup not finished

**Meaning.** Setup cannot be completed yet (HTTP 409).

**Likely cause.** The recovery passphrase has not been chosen.

**What to do.** Choose the recovery passphrase in the wizard, then finish setup.
