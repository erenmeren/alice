# Operator Guide

This guide is for the person who runs the Alice server. Commands run inside the `alice` container. On a
development machine use the `make` targets; on a server use
`sudo docker compose exec alice /usr/local/bin/alice <command>` in the Alice directory.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `alice setup-token --reset` | Prints a new one-time setup code to the terminal (never to a file). Any earlier code stops working. Works only while no administrator exists. Development: `make setup-token`. |
| `alice audit verify` | Verifies the audit hash chain. Exit code 0 and "The audit log is intact: … head hash …" when the chain is complete; exit code 1 and "Audit log integrity problem at entry N" otherwise. The check is itself recorded in the audit log (actor `cli`). |
| `alice admin reset-mfa <username>` | Removes the person's authenticator and recovery codes and ends their sessions; they enrol again at the next sign-in. Use it when the only administrator lost both phone and recovery codes. Recorded in the audit log as done by `cli`. It does not end a sign-in block. |
| `alice admin unlock <username>` | Ends the person's sign-in delay or 15-minute block and sets their failed sign-in count back to zero; nothing else changes. Use it when the only administrator is blocked after too many wrong attempts. Recorded in the audit log as `user.unlocked`, done by `cli`. Development: `make unlock ACCOUNT=<username>`. |
| `alice migrate` | Applies database migrations and exits. `alice serve` also applies them at startup. |

`alice audit verify` does not need the master key, so it works even when Alice refuses to start because of a
key problem.

## Database roles

Alice uses two PostgreSQL roles:

- The **owner** role (`ALICE_MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL`) creates and changes tables at startup.
- The **application** role `alice_app` (`ALICE_DATABASE_URL`) serves requests and runs the commands above. It can
  only add and read audit log entries, never change or delete them. A database trigger blocks changes even for
  the owner.

If `ALICE_MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL` is empty, Alice uses the application URL for both and logs a warning, because the
audit log is then protected by the triggers only.

In this release the owner role of the Docker Compose stack is the PostgreSQL superuser `alice`, and its URL is in
the `alice` container's environment. A superuser can switch the triggers off, so anyone who takes over the
`alice` container could rewrite the audit log. A dedicated non-superuser owner and a separate one-shot migration
container arrive with the installer packaging.

## Master key

Alice encrypts secrets (for example authenticator secrets) with a 256-bit master key in `master.key` inside the
keys directory (`/opt/alice/keys`). On the very first start Alice creates it (mode 0400). Afterwards:

- If the file is missing, Alice refuses to start ("the master key file is missing but this database already holds
  encrypted data"). Restore the file from your backup; Alice never creates a new key over existing data.
- If the file is different from the one the database was created with, Alice refuses to start ("the master key
  does not match this database").
- If the file permissions are wider than 0400, the file belongs to another user, or it is a symbolic link, Alice
  refuses to start and prints the command that fixes it (for example `chmod 0400 master.key`).

The server disk must use full-disk encryption: anyone who can read both the database and this file can decrypt the
secrets. The `alice` container has core dumps disabled so a crash never writes key material to disk.

## Checking an audit export outside Alice

The JSON export (`GET /api/v1/audit/export?format=json`, or **Export JSON** on the **Audit log** page) holds a
`verification` object (the result Alice computed, with `head_seq` and `head_hash`) and all `entries` in order.
Entries appended while the export was being written are not covered by `verification`. The response header
`X-Alice-Audit-Intact` carries the same result. Very large logs may not finish within the server's 60-second
response limit; use `alice audit verify` on the server in that case.

To recompute the chain yourself, for each entry in `seq` order:

1. Build the JSON object with exactly these keys in this order: `seq`, `at`, `actor_type`, `actor_id`,
   `actor_name`, `ip`, `action`, `object_type`, `object_id`, `result`, `details`, `request_id`. Write `null`
   `actor_id` and `ip` as `""`, write `at` in UTC with exactly six fractional digits
   (`2026-09-30T08:15:02.120000Z`), sort the `details` keys, use no spaces, and escape `<`, `>`, `&`, U+2028 and U+2029
   as `\u003c`, `\u003e`, `\u0026`, `\u2028` and `\u2029` (Go `encoding/json` rules); other non-ASCII characters stay
   as UTF-8.
2. `hash = SHA-256(previous hash || that JSON)`, where the previous hash of the first entry is 32 zero bytes.
3. Compare with the entry's `hash` (hex).

The CSV export is meant for spreadsheets: cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab or a carriage return
get a leading apostrophe, so use the JSON export for this check.

## Development stack reset

`make reset` deletes the development database and keys volumes and starts a fresh installation. Use it after
pulling Phase 1 onto a Phase 0 development stack (the new `alice_app` role is created only on a fresh database).
